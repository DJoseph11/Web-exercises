	<h1>National Park FAQ's</h1>
	<div>
		<dl>
			<dt>Q. Do you have to pay to get into a National Park?</dt>
			<dd>
				Not in the UK. Our National Parks were founded in the same post war social
				reforms that saw the creation of council housing and the NHS. They are free
				at the point of access and are also the homes and workplaces of millions of
				UK citizens.
			</dd>
			<dt>Q: Who collects the rubbish?</dt>
			<dd>
				National Parks Authorities don’t actually own much of the land or infrastructure in National Parks. If you put
				your rubbish in a bin it will usually be the local authority that collects it. If you drop it in the countryside
				it is no one’s job to pick it up. A volunteer might or a member of the public, but just as likely it’ll be a rare
				bird, a squirrel or a deer. Come to National Parks with the plan to take all your rubbish home.
			</dd>
			<dt>Q. But it’s OK to drop biodegradable waste like banana skins in the countryside, isn’t it?</dt>
			<dd>
				Nope. That skin will take ages to decompose and until then it is something in the natural environment that shouldn’t be there. Take it home too. Make a pledge to yourself before you go to a National Park that when you leave no one will be able to tell you’ve visited.
			</dd>
			<dt>Q. Can I get WiFi in National Parks?</dt>
			<dd>
				Not unless its supplied by your accommodation or the pub you’re sitting in. You might not even get a phone signal.
			</dd>
			<dt>Q. As a taxpayer I can camp or party all night long in National Parks, right?
			</dt>
			<dd>
				National Parks Authorities don’t actually own much of the land in National Parks. Most of it is privately owned and a great deal of it is 		particularly sensitive: either as a habitat or culturally. You need to follow the guidance given by each National Park about camping, it can be 	quite restrictive but that’s with good reason. National Parks are definitely not festival sites.
			</dd>
			<dt>Q. Can I have a camp fire to warm up or brew some tea?</dt>
			<dd>
				Definitely not. Fires damage the landscape even if they are kept under control. Wildfires cause irreparable damage every year and endanger life and property. They can last for days.
			</dd>
			<dt>Q. Can I bring my dog to a National Park?</dt>
			<dd>
				Please do, they’ll love it too. You need to keep them under control though and put a lead on when signs tell you to. There’s loads of areas with ground nesting birds and even the best behaved dogs will struggle to curb their natural instincts. And it goes without saying, if your dog does a poo – anywhere – bag it and bin it.

				Not unless its supplied by your accommodation or the pub you’re sitting in. You might not even get a phone signal.
