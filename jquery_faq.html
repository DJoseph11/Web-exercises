<h1>Hello</h1>
<dl>
	<dt>Q. Do you have to pay to get into a National Park?</dt>
	<dd>
		Not in the UK. Our National Parks were founded in the same post war social
		reforms that saw the creation of council housing and the NHS. They are free
		at the point of access and are also the homes and workplaces of millions of
		UK citizens.
	</dd>
	<dt>Q: Who collects the rubbish?</dt>
	<dd>
		National Parks Authorities don’t actually own much of the land or infrastructure in National Parks. If you put
		your rubbish in a bin it will usually be the local authority that collects it. If you drop it in the countryside
		it is no one’s job to pick it up. A volunteer might or a member of the public, but just as likely it’ll be a rare
		bird, a squirrel or a deer. Come to National Parks with the plan to take all your rubbish home.
	</dd>
	<dt>Q. But it’s OK to drop biodegradable waste like banana skins in the countryside, isn’t it?</dt>
	<dd>
		Nope. That skin will take ages to decompose and until then it is something in the natural environment that shouldn’t be there. Take it home too. Make a pledge to yourself before you go to a National Park that when you leave no one will be able to tell you’ve visited.
	</dd>
	<dt>Q. Can I get WiFi in National Parks?</dt>
	<dd>
		Not unless its supplied by your accommodation or the pub you’re sitting in. You might not even get a phone signal.
